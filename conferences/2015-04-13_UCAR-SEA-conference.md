### Abstract
Data Carpentry is an organization with the goal of teaching basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.
The rapid generation of large amounts of data is fundamentally changing how research is done. This deluge of data presents great opportunities, but also many challenges in managing, analyzing and sharing data. Data Carpentry teaches the skills that will enable researchers to be more effective and productive, to learners with little to no prior computational experience. Workshops teach best practices for data organization in spreadsheets, data cleaning, SQL for data management, and data analysis in R or Python. By the end of the workshop participants should be able to more effectively manage raw data and metadata and conduct data analyses in a more efficient and reproducible way.
